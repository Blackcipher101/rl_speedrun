# Connect Four with AlphaZero

AlphaZero self-play on Connect Four (6x7 board). A harder benchmark requiring deeper networks and more training.

## Running

```bash
python rl_fundamentals/27_game_applications/connect4_alphazero/solve_connect4_alphazero.py
```

Expected: ~80%+ win rate vs random after 100 iterations. Runtime: ~15-30 min.
