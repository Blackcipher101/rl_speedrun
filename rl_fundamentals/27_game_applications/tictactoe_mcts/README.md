# TicTacToe with Pure MCTS

Demonstrates that MCTS achieves near-perfect play on TicTacToe using only random rollouts (no neural networks).

## Running

```bash
python rl_fundamentals/27_game_applications/tictactoe_mcts/solve_tictactoe_mcts.py
```

Expected: ~99% win rate vs random with 1000 simulations. Runtime: ~2 min.
